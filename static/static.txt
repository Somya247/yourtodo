hahahahhahhah

make an environment first

python -m venv env (give desired name in env)

then activate it

.\env\Scripts\activate


if this error occurs
running scripts is disabled in this system when activating virtual environment

then

Open the command prompt or PowerShell as an administrator.
Run the following command to set the execution policy to RemoteSigned:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
When prompted, confirm the change by entering Y.
Activate your virtual environment again and try running your script.

then
pip install flask

pip install flask-sqlalchemy



#don't name files in caps other than the main folder

render_template renders the html page and is used with return

database banane k liye flask me ek class banana karna hoga aur usme fields, data type specify krna padega then we will execute this command

from app import app, db
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()


run the app.py file before creating db

    indentation ka khayal rakhna 

 and db ban jayega

then go to sql lite viewer and drag and drop the db created to view it

then install jinja2 snippet kit for jinja templating from extension

pura ban jaane ka baad 
pip install gunicorn
 then 
 pip freeze > requirements.txt 
 isse hamara saara files ka requirements aa jayega for whoever wants to install 

 then make a Procfile for heroku in order to deploy the application

 humlog js aur css file/folder add kar skate hai in static folder aur apna css ar js likh sakte hai

 agar heroku likhne se in powershell wo work na kre to go to the file location of heroku then go to bin then copy the file path go to env in search bar of pc then edit your env variables and add the path

C:\Program Files\heroku\bin

 then restart the application matlab vs code ko restart karna and PowerShell me heroku likhna 

 phir heroku login likhna in powershell aur login karne k baad powershell me email dikhayega jisse login hua hai

 lage haath git bhi install kar le
 isme bhi path wala kaam karna hoga like we did for heroku 

C:\Program Files\Git\bin

git init
git add
git coomit -m "Initial commit"
heroku create todo-somya (or whatever name you want)
